=============================

Python3 script that formats DHCP Request and BSDP Inform packets, broadcasts them on the local network, and then reports the responses. Responses provide insight into the DHCP and NetBoot services clients are able to reach.

  -t1, --testOne        Test code with stored BSDP response from OS X Server,
                        writing to /tmp/org.network.plist.
